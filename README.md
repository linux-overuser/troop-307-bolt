barebones-bootstrap4

A theme created by Callum Browne for the [Bolt CMS](https://bolt.cm).

Only tested with versions 3.0 and upwards.

Although you could in theory use this as your theme and have a fully functional, okay-looking website, this was very much designed with extendability in mind, hence the name. There's plenty of areas that you may wish to alter to tailor to your specific site.

Installation:
* Clone (or otherwise copy) this repository into your /public/theme directory
* Compile the /scss/bootstrap.scss file to the location /css/bootstrap.css (or if you only want stock Bootstrap, you can just download a bootstrap.css from wherever, ensuring it's Bootstrap 4)
* Update the theme in your config.yml file
* That's it!
